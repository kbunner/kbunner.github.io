											<h2><b>Cybersecurity and Software Engineering Intern | Summer 2018</b> </h2>
										</header>
										<p>I spent 12 weeks working for PwC’s advisory in their cybersecurity practice. My client was a large tech company and I worked on their <b> Bug Bounty program, focusing mostly on web vulnerabilities.</b> I also developed an <b>automation tool in JavaScript</b> to help improve the efficiency of assigning reported vulnerabilities to their correct owner. <br />
										My work was well-received and at the end of the summer <b>I was evaluated at the highest-level,</b> along with an offer for full-time employment.</p>

														<h2><b>Bug Bounty</b></h2>
														<p>Working on Bug Bounty I gained incredible exposure to real-life security vulnerabilities. The work focused mainly on web vulnerabilities like <b>XSS and subdomain takeovers.</b> I was involved in the process from beginning to end- <b>triaging</b> vulnerabilities reported on HackerOne, <b>assigning fixers</b> or helping <b>write defenses</b> myself, and <b>validating</b> the solutions of over a dozen bugs. </p>
													</li>
													<li>
														<h2><b>Automation Tool</b></h2>
														<p>Assigning tickets for fixing was often a tedious process that required checking multiple sources before an assignee could be determined. As a solution, I <b>built a dynamic web tool</b> to automate parts of this search process. Using Google Apps Script and Python, I created a tool to perform <b>API calls, parse</b> the information, and <b>map the data</b> to locate the owner of domains. While it was just a prototype, the feedback on the tool was positive and plans were made to build it out further.</p>

													<p>Spending a summer with PwC was an incredible experience because of their dedication to developing their people, including their interns. Over the summer we were given opportunities to <b>network with leaders</b> throughout the firm, receive mentoring from people at all levels of their career, and participate in a <b>nation wide case competition,</b>, which my team made to the semi-final round. At the completion of the internship, <b>I received an offer for full-time employment</b> which included a week-long trip to Disney World with everyone else who received an offer. This trip was jam packed with networking, team-building, and professional development opportunities. </p>

										<p>I spent my summer in LA working for Raytheon’s Space and Airborne Systems Business. I have always been interested in space and working at an aerospace company only fueled my enthusiasm.

										<p>I was lucky enough to take a seminar class with Dr. Herb Lin during the Winter of my sophomore year through Stanford’s Center for International Security and Cooperation. I was fascinated by Herb’s work, and his class was a huge motivation for my ultimate decision to major in computer science. Following this seminar, Dr. Lin invited me to spend the summer working for him. I proof read some of his papers, helped create content for his work on health-care related security, and created an archive of current events related to cyber security.</p>

											<h2>About me</h2>
										</header>
										<p>Hi there! Thanks for stopping by my page. My name is Kathryn Bunner and I recently graduated from <b>Stanford University with a B.S. in Computer Science</b>, focusing on information and data.<br /><br />
										
										I also received <b>a minor in Native American Studies</b>, which offered a great balance to my technical coursework, enhanced my ability to effectively articulate and defend complex topics, and increased my perspective on the many issues that impact contemporary Natives and other marginalized groups.<br />

										<br /> Beyond school, I served as President of the <b>American Indian Science and Engineering Society</b>, Financial Officer of the 2016 <b>Stanford Powwow </b> (one of the largest powwow’s in the country), and the Academic Chair for <b>the Tridelta Omega Chapter.</b> I also spent time tutoring undergraduates in computer science and a local middle school girl in learning to code. <br />

										<br />Currently, I am a Software Engineering Resident at <b>Google</b> in Mountain View, CA.</p>
