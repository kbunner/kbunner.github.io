									<h2>Internship Experiences</h2>

											<h2><b>Cybersecurity and Software Engineering Intern | Summer 2018</b> </h2>
										</header>
										<p>I spent 12 weeks working for PwC’s advisory in their cybersecurity practice. My client was a large tech company and I worked on their <b> Bug Bounty program, focusing mostly on web vulnerabilities.</b> I also developed an <b>automation tool in JavaScript</b> to help improve the efficiency of assigning reported vulnerabilities to their correct owner. <br />
										My work was well-received and at the end of the summer <b>I was evaluated at the highest-level,</b> along with an offer for full-time employment.</p>

													<li>
														<h2><b>Bug Bounty</b></h2>
														<p>Working on Bug Bounty I gained incredible exposure to real-life security vulnerabilities. The work focused mainly on web vulnerabilities like <b>XSS and subdomain takeovers.</b> I was involved in the process from beginning to end- <b>triaging</b> vulnerabilities reported on HackerOne, <b>assigning fixers</b> or helping <b>write defenses</b> myself, and <b>validating</b> the solutions of over a dozen bugs. </p>
													</li>
													<li>
														<h2><b>Automation Tool</b></h2>
														<p>Assigning tickets for fixing was often a tedious process that required checking multiple sources before an assignee could be determined. As a solution, I <b>built a dynamic web tool</b> to automate parts of this search process. Using Google Apps Script and Python, I created a tool to perform <b>API calls, parse</b> the information, and <b>map the data</b> to locate the owner of domains. While it was just a prototype, the feedback on the tool was positive and plans were made to build it out further.</p>
													</li>
													</ul>
												</div>
												<div>
													<p>Spending a summer with PwC was an incredible experience because of their dedication to developing their people, including their interns. Over the summer we were given opportunities to <b>network with leaders</b> throughout the firm, receive mentoring from people at all levels of their career, and participate in a <b>nation wide case competition,</b>, which my team made to the semi-final round. At the completion of the internship, <b>I received an offer for full-time employment</b> which included a week-long trip to Disney World with everyone else who received an offer. This trip was jam packed with networking, team-building, and professional development opportunities. </p>

											<h2><b>Software Engineering Intern | Summer 2017</b> </h2>

										<p>I spent my summer in LA working for Raytheon’s Space and Airborne Systems Business. I have always been interested in space and working at an aerospace company only fueled my enthusiasm. Over the summer I developed a series of static analysis checkers using C++, as well as compiling guidelines for next-generation best practices in Hardware based on recent publications. At the end of the summer <b>I was chosen to represent the cyber interns and present my work to regional management.</b> </p>

													<p>Spending a summer at Raytheon was a great opportunity to take a <b>step out of my comfort zone.</b> I moved to LA know 0 people there, and spent the summer exploring and making new friends along with learning about software engineering in industry.

											<h2><b>Cybersecurity Research Intern | Summer 2016 </b> </h2>
										</header>
										<p>I was lucky enough to take a seminar class with Dr. Herb Lin during the Winter of my sophomore year through Stanford’s Center for International Security and Cooperation. I was fascinated by Herb’s work, and his class was a huge motivation for my ultimate decision to major in computer science. Following this seminar, Dr. Lin invited me to spend the summer working for him. I proof read some of his papers, helped create content for his work on health-care related security, and created an archive of current events related to cyber security.</p>
