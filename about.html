											<h2>Hi There!</h2>
										</header>
										<p>Thanks for stopping by my page. My name is Kathryn Bunner and I recently graduated from Stanford University <br /><br />

										While at Stanford I studied <b>Computer Science, with a focus on information and data.</b> This track utilizes techniques like machine learning and data mining and applies it to a variety of areas, such as data models, security, and NLP. It was important to gain exposure to a variety of topics in computing through my coursework. My courses included classes like, <b> Applied Machine Learning, Data Management and Data Systems, Computer and Network Security, Object Oriented Systems Design, and Web Applications. </b> <br /><br />

										I am most interested in roles and projects that involve writing lots of code, using large amounts of data, and always challenging me to learn new skills. To learn more about some of the projects I have worked on, check out the projects and internship pages. <br /><br />
										
										I also received <b>a minor in Native American Studies</b>, which offered a great balance to my technical coursework. The small class sizes of Native Studies courses provided an intimate environment and required active participation for discussion of the material. The minor <b>enhanced my ability effectively articulate and defend complex topics,</b> while giving me perspective on many issues that impact contemporary Natives and other marginalized groups.<br />

										<br />Outside of academics, I definitely keep busy. At Stanford, I was quite active with a variety of groups and held numerous leadership positions. I held a leadership position in Stanford's chapter of the <b>American Indian Science and Engineering Society,</b> for all four years of undergraduate, including serving as <b>President</b> during my senior year. I served as the <b>Financial Officer of the 2016 Stanford Powwow </b> (one of the largest powwow’s in the country). Along with being an active member of Stanford Tridelta, I was able to serve as the Recruitment co-lead and the Academic Chair, which included being a part of the Standards Committee.<br />

										<br />I worked for the School of Engineering Diversity Office, as a coordinator for the Opportunity Job Fair. It was Stanford’s only job fair dedicated to diversity in STEM, which brought in over 100 companies. I also spent time working as a tutor in computer science for undergraduates and for a local middle school girl who was interested in learning to code. <br / >

										<br /> I like to be active and exploring new things. My favorite ways to do this are backpacking in our National Parks with friends or following the advice of Where to Go When and traveling to new places. Otherwise, you can probably find me cheering on Stanford football, reading new books, scrolling through the Twitter pages of many of NASA’s missions, playing boardgames with friends (Santorini is my favorite) or baking (gf) banana bread.</p>
