											<h2>Hi There!</h2>
										</header>
										<p>Thanks for stopping by my page. I spent the first 18 years of my life in Omaha, Nebraska. I moved to California to attend Stanford University a few years ago and the Bay Area has become my home. While at Stanford I studied Computer Science, with a focus on information and data. This track utilizes techniques like machine learning and data mining and applies it to a variety of areas, such as data models, security, and NLP. I have experience coding in a variety of languages and have tried to take coursework to give me a broad look at different areas of the field. I am most interested in roles and projects that involve writing lots of code, using large amounts of data, and always challenging me to learn new skills. Through internship experience and coursework I have applied my computing knowledge to a wide range of projects. I  detailed some of my favorite projects on the main page and included GitHub repositories where I can.<br /><br />
										
										I also received a minor in Native American Studies, which offered a great balance to my technical coursework. The small class sizes of Native Studies courses provided an intimate environment and required active participation for discussion of the material. The minor enhanced my ability effectively articulate and defend complex topics and gave me perspective on many issues that impact contemporary Natives and other marginalized groups.<br />

										<br />Outside of academics, I definitely keep busy. At Stanford, I was actively involved with the Stanford Native Community. I held a leadership position in Stanford’s chapter of the American Indian Science and Engineering Society, including President during my senior year. I served as the Financial Officer of the 2016 Powwow (one of the largest powwow’s in the country). I worked for the School of Engineering Diversity Office, coordinating Stanford’s only job fair dedicated to diversity in STEM. I was an active member of Stanford Tridelta, and held leadership positions there.<br />

										<br /> I like to be active and exploring new things. My favorite ways to do this are backpacking in our National Parks with friends or following the advice of Where to Go When and traveling to new places. Otherwise, you can probably find me cheering on Stanford football, scrolling through the Twitter pages of many of NASA’s missions, playing boardgames with friends (Santorini is my favorite) or baking (gf) banana bread.</p>
