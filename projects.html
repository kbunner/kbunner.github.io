											<h2>Yup'ik / English Language Translation Tool</h2>
										</header>
										<p>Overview: As part of the AISES National Conference miniHackathon, my team built the first iteration of what went on to be Yugtun. It is a web app to do translations between Yup’ik, a Native Alaskan language, and English. </p>
										<p>During the Hackathon, I created a Python script to parse a PDF document of rough Yup’ik/English translations and used this to construct the backend data structure. Like many Native American languages, the Yup’ik language has few living speakers left, therefore, language revitalization efforts are critical to preserve the language. Our goal was to begin the process of creating a more accessible and comprehensive translation tool to preserve the Yup’ik language. One of our team members continued working on the project and the current form of it can be found at the link below.</p>
										<h3>Tools: Python</h3>
										<p>Made for the 2017 AISES National Conference miniHackathon. Our team was awarded first place. </p>

									<h2>Dora</h2>
									<p>Overview: Dora was a dynamic web application built for my Senior Project. Dora allows users to enter a location and a variety of preferences and receive three suggestions for different meals or activities. </p>

									<p>The motivating idea was that while there are an abundance of resources to help plan and find places to do while traveling, the amount of choices available can sometimes be overwhelming. Our application takes in preferences, learns over time, and gives the user 3 option rather than hundreds. The backend works by taking in the user’s preferences, making API calls to Yelp and Google Places, and then makes some choices about which options to return to the user. This was my first time doing web development and using APIs, so there was a bit of a learning curve, but it was a great opportunity to develop a project completely from scratch. </p>

									<p>Tools: JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Node.JS </p>
