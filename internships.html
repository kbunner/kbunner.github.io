										<h2>Cybersecurity and Privacy Summer Associate </h2>
										<h3>Summer 2017 | San Francisco, CA</h3>
										<p>I spent 12 weeks working for PwC’s advisory in their cybersecurity practice. My client was a large tech company and I worked on their Bug Bounty program, focusing mostly on web vulnerabilities. I also developed an automation tool in JavaScript to help improve the efficiency of assigning reported vulnerabilities to their correct owner. <br />
										My work was well-received and at the end of the summer I was evaluated at the highest-level, along with an offer for full-time employment.</p>

									<h1>Raytheon</h1>
									<h2>Software Engineering Intern</h2>

									<h3>Summer 2017 | El Segundo, CA</h3>
									<p>I spent my summer in LA working for Raytheon’s Space and Airborne Systems Business. I have always been interested in space and working at an aerospace company only fueled my enthusiasm. Over the summer I developed a series of static analysis checkers using C++, as well as compiling guidelines for next-generation best practices in Hardware based on recent publications. At the end of the summer I was chosen to represent the cyber interns and present my work to regional management. </p>

									<h1>Stanford Center For Internation Security and Cooperation</h1>
									<h2>Cybersecurity Research Intern </h2>
									<h3>Summer 2016 | Stanford, CA</h3>
								</header>
								<p>I was lucky enough to take a seminar class with Dr. Herb Lin during the Winter of my sophomore year through Stanford’s Center for International Security and Cooperation. I was fascinated by Herb’s work, and his class was a huge motivation for my ultimate decision to major in computer science. Following this seminar, Dr. Lin invited me to spend the summer working for him. I proof read some of his papers, helped create content for his work on health-care related security, and created an archive of current events related to cyber security.</p>
