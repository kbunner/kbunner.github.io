									<h2>Software Projects</h2>
								</header>
								<p>Below you will find descriptions of some of my favorite projects. I have included GitHub links where I can. My preferred language is Python, and I have a fair amount of experience with Java, JavaScript, HTML, C++ and SQL. I have also worked with Julia, C, Android, and Google Apps Scipts before. </p>

										<h3>Language Tools</h3>
										<p>Looking for ways to combine my technical skills and my passion for Native Communities, I have been a part of two projects that have focused on language revitalization efforts for Indigenous languages. Continuing to develop tools that are community focused and culturally aware is a huge part of my career aspirations.</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<span class="icon major style3 fa-code"></span>
										<h3>Web Development</h3>
										<p>My first experience building a web application came from the neccessity of needing to showcase my senior project. Since then I have taken more courses, like <i>Web Development</i> and <i>Computer Security</i>, as well as completed side projects, like this site, to further develop my ability to program web applications.</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<span class="icon major style1 fa-code-fork"></span>
										<h3>Machine Learning</h3>
										<p>This is a hot topic in the field of Computing and is an area I am trying to gain more knowledge in. There are so many important applications and as we all know data contains value and knowledge. My projects include an interactive Chatbot and a game playing agent, which have allowed me to apply various Algorithms to fun problems spaces. </p>

										<h3>Systems Programming</h3>
										<p>Stanford ensures that their engineering graduates are well-rounded and require all Computer Science majors to take at least two systems classes, giving us an understanding of how computer systems execute programs and manipulate data, working from the C programming language down to the microprocessor. My final project was a complex Map Reduce system that took advantage of parrallel computing. While this is not an area I have a strong desire to continue working in, I am thankful to have a strong background in understanding how machines works. </p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<span class="icon major style2 fa-comments"></span>
										<h3>Android</h3>
										<p> Learning to use Android Studio definitely had a bit of a learning curve, but it was an area I am glad I have exposure to. Through a course on Object Oriented Systems Design, I completed 8 Android Applications, mostly for game playing. The largest was a multi-class game player and editor developed with a team of 3 other students. This work gave me a strong appreciation for people who do UI/UX work and gave me a great experience working with a team to build a software project.</p>

									<h2>Internship Experiences</h2>
									<p>One of the things that first brought me to computer science was an interest in cyber security. I have tried to focus my summer experiences on gaining more knowledge around cyber security, while also building general software engineering skills. Below is an overview of some of my internship experiences. Click on the "+" icon to learn more! </p>
